* Charles Choi Emacs Configuration Files

This directory contains Elisp files used by Charles Choi to customize his usage of Emacs.

Initially ~ccinit.el~ is loaded from ~init.el~. Personal variable configuration (~custom-set-variables~, ~custom-set-faces~) is stored in ~custom.el~. Note that ~init.el~ is *not* included in this repo, however its relevant contents are shown below:

#+begin_src elisp
  ;; CC's Emacs Init File.

  (require 'package) ;; You might already have this line
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)

  (setq cc/cclisp-path (concat (getenv "HOME") "/" "emacs/cclisp"))

  (setq load-path (cons cc/cclisp-path load-path))

  (package-initialize) ;; You might already have this line
  (unless package-archive-contents
    (package-refresh-contents))

  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-install 'use-package))

  (load "ccinit")

  (setq custom-file (concat cc/cclisp-path "/" "custom.el"))
  (load custom-file 'noerror)

  (put 'dired-find-alternate-file 'disabled nil)
#+end_src

From ~ccinit.el~, all other Elisp files in this directory are loaded.
